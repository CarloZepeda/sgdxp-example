## Using Service Guard for Liferay DXP
This is a project that demonstrates how to use [Service Guard for Liferay DXP](https://xtivia.github.io/sgdxp/). Service Guard enables the use of simple Java annotations to mark JAX-RS based REST services that we wish to protect using Liferay 7 DXP's Role Based Access Control (RBAC) system. 

Note that while the focus here is on Liferay 7 DXP Service Guard also works just fine using Liferay CE as well.
